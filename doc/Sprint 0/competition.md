  Our product will be more efficient in searching for compatible PC Parts.
  We will also allow  users to share their builds on social media and other fun
  things. This will enable us to cater to a younger audience and hopefully lead
  the way for the next generation of PC builders.
  We feel like other websites don't focus on the younger crowd because they may
  be seen as incompetent, when in reality, children are as, if not more intelligent
  than fully grown adults.
  Our UI will be better as well. Less steps will be required to configure your
  dream build.
