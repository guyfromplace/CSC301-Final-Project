PERSONA
-Key Persona:Francesco - a 35 year old father and an accountant at Complete Economics Inc.

Francesco remembers that building a PC online was the fastest and cheapest way.

-Key Persona:Christina - a 20 year old college student with a passion for competitive gaming. Christina likes to keep her computer up to date with the latest hardware to prevent any issues with her twitch streaming. Christina wants maximum control over creating her computer. She may want to buy specific parts or a whole new computer.

SCENERIO
-Key Scenerio: Francesco - It has been many years since Francesco last bought a computer and is now unfamiliar with all the new technology and terminology. Francesco is too busy with the family and working from 9am to 6pm as an accountant, to do any research on a computer. Francesco needs an easy system that will help him step by step in choosing computer parts that fit his gaming needs.

-Key Scenerio: Christina: Christina is ambitious when it comes to choosing her computer parts. Well she may be well versed in the terminology and hardware, she still may not know if some parts will cause bottle necking in others. She wants to maximize her builds. As a college student, Christina doesn't have much of a budget to experiment with computer hardware. She needs a place where she can post her ideas for a PC and ask for other peoples opinion.

PRINCIPLE
-the website should create a health balance between user assistance, by guiding them through the PC building process, and user freedom, by letting them experience with different PC builds. 

-The user should not be able to notice the user assistance. They user should feel the satisfaction of building their own PC without realizing that the website guided them through the process.
