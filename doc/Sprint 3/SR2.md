### Altered Stories
We completed all the user stories we assigned to ourselves in Sprint 2. 

### Practices to Continue
* Continue doing weekly sprint meetings since it lets the group to communicate and keep organized. 
* Keep the repository organized at all times by creating local branches for any new features.
* Continue having a longer meeting before the demo to ensure all the merging of the branches goes smoothly
and that everyone can still run the project.
* Continue designing every user story to have a deliverable.
* Assigning tasks in an even manner.

### Practices to Start Doing
* Have earlier weekly meetings to go over what has been and what needs to be done
* Use the user story IDs in the commit messages and follow the same convention for all commits
* Start giving estimates as to when tasks will be completed
* Let others know when you start a task so they can come to you for questions
* Amend smaller unimportant commits (like fixing spelling mistakes) with larger commits


### Harmful Practices to Stop
* Not keeping consistent format for branch names and git commits
* Pushing unintended changes in master without double checking (missing/lost files)
* Renaming files without informing the whole group

### Best Experience and Worst Experience
* The best experience for this sprint was seeing all trhe changes we made from our last sprint pay off in
the demo, since it went very well
* The worst experience was having to deal with conflicts from merging all the git branches at the very end of the sprint.
