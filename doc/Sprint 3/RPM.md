The main goal in this sprint 3 release was to implement account and build functionality into the website. We wanted to allow users to 
create accounts on the website which would allow the save information there, as well as start and save in progress system builds
as well. Additionally, we finished adding in all other parts to be availible to be on display on the website.

#163776434: Making Accounts: the done condition for this story was to allow the user to input new acocunt details, and they would 
make a new account if the new details were unique.

#164347698: Sign in Account: the done criteria for this story was to let the user input valid login info, then allow them to
sign in to thier account on the website, giving them access to account specific features.

#164347815: Sign out Account: the done condition for this story was when a logged in user clicked the sign out button, they would sign
out of their account and return to the normal user mode.

#164311912: Display all parts: this was the final user story for the displaying all parts, it is done when all parts in the database
are displayed on the website.

#163776893: Make system builds: the done condition of this story was to let the user select individual parts then add them to an overall
system build, where the user could then view the build. 

Implementing these features added more functionality to our website, but during final testing some bugs were discovered and could not
have been fixed before release time. For the future sprints, new stories for fixing these bugs and polishing some of the older stories
must be added.
