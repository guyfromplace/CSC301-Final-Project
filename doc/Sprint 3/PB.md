__Complexity Scale:__
We have decided to use a Fibonacci scale when rating the complexity of our user stories.
A 1 on the scale represents a trivial task, and increasing numbers represent increasing complexities.
In order to fit our complexity scale to Pivotal Tracker's, 2 or 3 is a 1, 5 or 8 is a 2 and 13 or 21 is a 3.
