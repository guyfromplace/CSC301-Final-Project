The main goal in this sprint 4 release was to improve the look and functionality of the website. To do this we updated the look of
the front page along with the button on the website, and then made a page allowing users with saved builds on their accounts
to see them all neatly.

#164945084: Part Images: this story was designed to allow displaying of all pictures of parts on our website.

#164945369: Main Page Buttons: The done condition for this story was to have picture button for the front mage, making it look nicer.

#164945463: Display User Builds: The done condition for this story was to have apage where users could see all of their saved builds.

#163966711: Make Logo: A logo was designed for our website to be displayed on the front page.

Implementing these features allowed us to finish the most common use case of this project, namely allowing users to create and
then save builds of parts from the website, then made it look more appealing to the users.
