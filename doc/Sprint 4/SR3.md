### Altered Stories
We completed all the user stories we assigned to ourselves in Sprint 3. 

### Practices to Continue
* Continue doing weekly sprint meetings since it lets the group to communicate and keep organized. 
* Keeping the repository organized at all times by creating local branches for any new features.
* Continue having a longer meeting before the demo to ensure all the merging of the branches goes smoothly
and that everyone can still run the project.
* Having earlier weekly meetings to go over what has been and what needs to be done
* Using the user story IDs in the commit messages and follow the same convention for all commits

### Practices to Start Doing
* Start giving estimates as to when tasks will be completed
* Let others know when you start a task so they can come to you for questions
* Amend smaller unimportant commits (like fixing spelling mistakes) with larger commits
* Assign more developers to front-end tasks since the work is beginning to become uneven


### Harmful Practices to Stop
* Pushing unintended changes in master without double checking (missing/lost files)
* Renaming files without informing the whole group
* Leaving things to the last minute, causes extra stress.

### Best Experience and Worst Experience
* The worst experience was the crunch time spent right before the sprint deadline.
* The best experience for this sprint was surviving the crunch and ending with a finished product.
