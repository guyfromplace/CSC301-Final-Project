The main goal in this sprint two release was to have a working webpage that displayed the computer parts we had for sale, and allow
the user to search and filter the results on the webpage.

#164126740: Displaying CPU: this story was developed after sprint 0, so there was no initial definition for done. The group defined
done when the story was created as having a webpage that listed all CPUs and their information from our database.

#164127942: Displaying Motherboard: this story was developed after sprint 0, so there was no initial definition for done. The group defined
done when the story was created as having a webpage that listed all Motherboards and their information from our database.

#164128039: Search for CPU by Name: the initial definition for done was to be able to search the displayed parts using keywords and
then update the webpage to show the matching parts. The group reevaluated this definition to only search using only one keyword or string
and checking if any product name contained that keyword.

#164128068: Search for Motherboard by Name: this story was branched off #164128039, so we defined it as done when we could use the
algorithm designed there and adapt it into the Motherboard webpage.

#164128088: Filter CPUs: The initial definition of done for filtering was to have tags applied to items and allow the user to filter
based off these tags. Our database was deisgned with these tags in mind, but for this sprint we only developed the filters for brand
and price for CPUs, the rest will be implented later.

#164128108: Filter Motherboards: The initial definition of done for filtering was to have tags applied to items and allow the user to filter
based off these tags. Our database was deisgned with these tags in mind, but for this sprint we only developed the filters for brand
and price for motherboards, the rest will be implented later.


Completing these preceding stories allowed us to have the framework set up for our website, and we will easily be able to add the pages
and features for the remaining parts in the next sprint.
