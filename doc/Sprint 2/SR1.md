### Atlered Stories
*As a user, I want to be able to see  a page with parts displayed for me

### Practices to Continue
*Our group wants to continue doing weekly sprint meetings since it also the group to communicate and keep organized. 
*Our group wants to keep git organized at all times by creating local branches for any new features.

### Practices to Start Doing
* convert user story to be more deliverable oriented
* have earlier weekly meeting to go over what has been and what needs to be done 
* have end of sprint meeting to prepare for the demo

### Harmful Practices to Stop
* user stories are too broad and generic
* we focused on developing through layers rather than through deliverables

### Best Experience and Worst Experience
* the best experience was working together as a team and not having any conflicts among ourselves.
