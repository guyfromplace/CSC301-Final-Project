The main goal in this sprint one release was to complete the following user stories; Basic UI Implementation and 
Set Up Database. 

#163776424: Set Up Database: the inital definition of done was to have flood the database with at least 200 documents. The group 
re-evaluated this as being too ambitions and has decided to re-define done for this sprint. Instead, in the sprint the group has
defined the database schema and set up a mlab account.

#163776595: Basic UI Implementation: We inital did not define done for basic UI implementation in our original sprint. We later 
defined done as having a menu bar and a CSS style sheet. 

No other user stories were consider in this sprint as the group felt that the basic structure for the website was needed for any
future user story.

In the process.md file, we discussed separating the tasks to work on user stories in smaller groups and coming together later to 
put everything together. This group did this again for this sprint. Albert Yang and Philip Correia worked on the website front end 
with the Basic UI Implementation user story. Zhao Chen, Jack He, and Philip Rachwalski worked on worked on the Database user story. 
Group were made based on experience and interest.
